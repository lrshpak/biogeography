# Biogeography
My biogeography class has lots of equations that we use, so I figured I write up the equations in code so I can easily calculate them
##### Species.java
 - Calculates three equations for species diversity in one region
 - Data is based off an exercise we did in class with three different sites in one region
 - Equations are: Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index, Evenness, and Simpson's Diversity Index
